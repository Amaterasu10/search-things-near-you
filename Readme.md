# search-things-near-you

## About
This is made using [Tomtom's "maps sdk for web V6"](https://api.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-for-web/6.x/6.14.0/documentation/dist/modules/Maps.html).
I decided to use Tomtom's sdk because compared to Google's API, it doesn't require a credit card.

### Purpose: Search things( places || restaurants || businesses ) near your location.

### Current progress: 
- [x] Research 
    - [x] Look for resources
    Resources found :
        - google API : Maps javascript API / Places API / Maps Embed API
        - manticoresearch
        - tomtom

    - [x] determine the best resources to implement
    - [ ] learning how to implement
